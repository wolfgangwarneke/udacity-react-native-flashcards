## About my Mobile Flashcards project

Are you tired of getting paper cuts studying for your Spanish exam? Do you want to memorize the director of every single Arnold Schwarzeneggar movie? Or maybe you're just trying to learn some good ol' React Native... Well with this Udacity React Nanodegree project you can absolutely study all of these things and more with your own DECKS and CARDS, in the classic flashcard format we've all grown to love. Just broadcast this app to your smartphone locally with Expo and you're good to go.
